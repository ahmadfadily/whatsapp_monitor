# whatsapp_monitor
A tool that helps the user to use whatsapp in a very special way.
The tool helps the user and give him multiple choices :
1. saves in a log the status of a contact, in other words the tool let you know when a wanted contact is online and calculates the time he spent while online + 
notifies the user via whatsapp/gmail/soundplay when he start typing or when he becomes online (a sneaky way to know if the person ignoring you :) ).
2. connect you quickly to a chat with a wanted number, with my tool you don't have to add a specific number as a contact then talk to him, you can immediately put
the phone number in and start a convertasion with him.


to run it :
1. run the main folder
2. choose whether you want to create a conversation with someone or track a status.
3. scan the QR (you only need to scan it once).
4. you can find the output of the log in the StatusLogFiles directory in a file called status.txt.
